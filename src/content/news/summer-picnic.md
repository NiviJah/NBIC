What a fantastic day! Our annual Summer Picnic at Centennial Park was a resounding success, with over 100 community members in attendance. The weather was perfect, the food was delicious, and the company was even better.

Highlights included a tug-of-war competition, face painting for the kids, and a surprise musical performance by local artists. It was heartwarming to see so many new faces connecting with long-time members.

A huge thank you to our volunteers who arrived early to set up and stayed late to clean up. Events like this wouldn't be possible without your dedication. We're already looking forward to next year!
