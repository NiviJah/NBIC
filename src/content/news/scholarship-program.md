The New Brunswick Israeli Community (NBIC) is thrilled to launch our inaugural Scholarship Program. This initiative is designed to support students within our community who are pursuing post-secondary education in New Brunswick. 

We believe in investing in the future leaders of our community. Two scholarships of $1,000 each will be awarded for the upcoming academic year. Applicants must demonstrate academic achievement, community involvement, and a commitment to fostering cultural understanding.

Applications open on November 1st and close on January 31st. We encourage all eligible students to apply and take advantage of this opportunity.
