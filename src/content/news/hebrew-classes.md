Shalom! We are excited to announce the schedule for our Fall Hebrew Classes. Whether you are looking to learn the aleph-bet for the first time or want to polish your conversational skills, we have a class for you.

Classes will be held on Tuesday and Thursday evenings at the Community Centre. We are offering three levels:

1. **Beginner:** Introduction to reading and basic vocabulary.
2. **Intermediate:** Grammar fundamentals and sentence structure.
3. **Advanced:** Conversational practice and current events discussion.

Spaces are limited, so please register early to secure your spot. Learning a language is a wonderful way to connect with culture and heritage.
